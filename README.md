# Penguin Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying penguins into two species (Adelie and Gentoo) based on various physical measurements. The dataset used is the Palmer Penguins dataset, which includes features like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts the species of a penguin given its physical measurements. The ultimate aim is to achieve a model that can predict penguins with 100% accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Palmer Penguins dataset, which is available in the `data` directory. It includes features such as:
- Bill Length
- Bill Depth
- Flipper Length
- Body Mass
- Species (Target Variable)

Feel free to explore and analyze the dataset to understand the characteristics of the penguin species.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Notebooks (iPythonNotebook)**: Jupyter Notebooks are used for exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: The machine learning library used for building the classification model.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization and creating plots to analyze the dataset.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin-classification.git
    cd penguin-classification
    ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data and train the classification model.

3. Experiment with different algorithms, parameters, and features to achieve the desired accuracy.

## Notebooks

- `1_penguins_binary_classification`: Notebook for exploring and analyzing the dataset.
- `2_logistic_regression`: Notebook for training the penguin classification model.

## Results

The trained model and evaluation results can be found in the `models` directory.
